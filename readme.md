## End-User Files

Data products intended for end-user usage are located in the `visualizations` folder.

<a id='data-visualization-files'></a>
#### Data Visualization Files

The `visualizations` folder contains interactive HTML files for dissemination. These HTML files are ready to use immediately upon download.

**Requirements** : The only software required is a browser that can render SVG and JavaScript enabled. Most modern browsers are able to do this except for Internet Explorer, which may result in unpredictable rendering of visualizations and interaction capability.

**Recommended Browsers**
  - Chrome
  - Safari
  - FireFox

#### Jupyter Notebooks

Final visualizations are made in `jupyter` and published as interactive pages by the `nbinteract` package. Both were developed in the Python programming language.
